I am a robotics engineer who is on a mission to use technology to improve the lives and wellbeing of humans. I am currently a first year PhD student at [Imperial-X](https://ix.imperial.ac.uk/) and the Department of Computing Imperial 
College London where I am exploring the use of robotics and AI to empower persons with limited functional independence such as persons with dementia to live independently in their homes. I have vast experience in technology and software development with industry experience at organisations such as Microsoft, SAP and PGIM Ireland. 

I was previously a researcher at the [Bristol Robotics Lab](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com/). I am also a co-organiser of the [Imperial Computing Conference](https://icc.doc.ic.ac.uk). Besides my research, I am an advocate for sustainability and equality. I am a member of the Equality Diversity and Culture Committee (EDCC) at Imperial College London.
