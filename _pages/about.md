About
======
I am currently a PhD student at I-X, Imperial College London where I am exploring the use of robotics and AI to empower persons with limited functional independence such as persons with dementia to live independently in their homes. I was previously a researcher at the [Bristol Robotic Lab](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com/). I am a co-organiser of the [Imperial Computing Conference](https://icc.doc.ic.ac.uk).
