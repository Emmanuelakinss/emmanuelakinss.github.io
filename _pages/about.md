About
======
I am currently a first year PhD student at [Imperial-X](https://ix.imperial.ac.uk/) and the Department of Computing Imperial College London where I am exploring the use of robotics and AI to empower persons with limited functional independence such as persons with dementia to live independently in their homes. I was previously a researcher at the [Bristol Robotics Lab](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com/). I am also co-organiser of the [Imperial Computing Conference](https://icc.doc.ic.ac.uk) and a member of the Equality Diversity and Culture Committee (EDCC) at Imperial College London.
