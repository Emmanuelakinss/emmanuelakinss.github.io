I am a robotics engineer on a mission to use technology to improve the lives and well-being of humans. I am currently a PhD student at [I-X](https://ix.imperial.ac.uk/i-x-phd-research-spotlight-emmanuel-akinrintoyo/) and the Department of Computing Imperial 
College London where I am exploring the use of robotics and AI to empower persons with limited functional independence such as persons with dementia to live independently in their homes. 

I am passionate about diversity and technology ethics. At Imperial, I am a member of the Equality Diversity and Culture Committee (EDCC). I am the only student member of the [Science, Engineering and Technology Research Ethics Committee (SETREC)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/research-ethics-committee/committees/setrec/) that oversees non-health-related research at the institution. To improve the student experience, I co-organise the [Imperial Computing Conference](https://icc.doc.ic.ac.uk) held twice yearly with keynote speakers from industry and academia. I am also the PhD Representative of my cohort

I have vast experience in technological design and software development with industry experience at organisations such as Microsoft, SAP and PGIM Ireland. At these organisations, I explored aspects of cloud and data technology, enterprise software, and consumer software used by millions of users. 

I was previously a researcher at the [Bristol Robotics Lab](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com/) where I completed a master's in research in Robotics and Autonomous Systems. Besides my research, I am an advocate for sustainability. I share my ideas through avenues such as the [St. Gallen Symposium](https://symposium.org/top-25-essays-52nd-gec/) where my essay was ranked in the top 25/700+ essays globally.
