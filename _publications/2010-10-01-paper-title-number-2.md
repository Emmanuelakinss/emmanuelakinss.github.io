excerpt: 'Optical transmission systems provide high capacity, low latency and jitter, and high reliability for city-scale networks. Recirculating loop experiments have facilitated the study of signal propagation in long-haul optical transmission systems. However, they are unsuited for developing control and management software for city-scale optical networks with dozens or hundreds of reconfigurable optical add drop multiplexer (ROADM) units, diverse interconnection topologies, and dynamic traffic patterns....'
