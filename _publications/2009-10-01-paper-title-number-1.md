Abstract:
We measure the performance of separately characterized machine learning-based EDFA models for predicting the optical power spectrum evolution in a 5-span system with six ROADM nodes deployed in the COSMOS testbed, which achieve a mean absolute error of 0.6â€“0.7 dB after 10 EDFAs under varying channel loading configurations.
