excerpt: 'Individual cognitive stimulation therapy (iCST) is an effective therapeutic intervention that has been explored for aiding the cognitive ability of persons with dementia (PwDs). Despite its significant benefits, research evidence shows that it has been limited due to the burdens of caregivers, thus leading to low adherence. Therefore, this work explores the development of a social robot by co-designing with the key stakeholders for a 4-week in-home deployment in the homes of 10 PwDs. The systemâ€™s effectiveness will be evaluated by assessing changes in the quality of life of the users and the caregiving burdens of their carers.'
